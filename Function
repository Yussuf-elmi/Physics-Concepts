📘 Functions: The Mathematical Backbone of Software
🔹 What is a Function?

In mathematics, a function is a rule that maps an input to exactly one output.
Example in math:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
f(x)=x
2

This means: take a number, square it, and return the result.

In programming, a function is the same idea—except it can process not just numbers, but also text, images, or even data structures.

🔹 Why Functions Matter in Software

Reusability – Write code once, use it many times.

Abstraction – Hide complex details and expose only what’s necessary.

Composability – Functions can be combined like Lego blocks to build larger systems.

🔹 Real-World Applications

Search Engines – Query in → search results out.

Banking Systems – Input: transaction details → Output: updated balance.

E-commerce – Input: price → Output: final price after discount + tax.

AI Models – Input: data (text, image) → Output: prediction/label.

🔹 Example Project: Mini Shopping Assistant

This project shows how functions transform input step by step.

# Mini Shopping Assistant

def apply_discount(price, discount_rate=0.1):
    """Apply a discount to the price (default: 10%)."""
    return price * (1 - discount_rate)

def add_tax(price, tax_rate=0.16):
    """Add tax to the price (default: 16%)."""
    return price * (1 + tax_rate)

def checkout():
    print("=== Welcome to the Mini Shopping Assistant ===")
    
    # Ask the user to enter a price
    price = float(input("Enter the product price: "))
    
    # Apply discount and tax
    discounted_price = apply_discount(price)
    final_price = add_tax(discounted_price)
    
    # Display results
    print("\n--- Receipt ---")
    print(f"Original Price: {price:.2f}")
    print(f"After Discount: {discounted_price:.2f}")
    print(f"Final Price (with tax): {final_price:.2f}")
    print("\nThanks for shopping with us!")

# Run the program
checkout()

🔹 How it Works

The program asks for input (price of a product).

A discount function reduces the price.

A tax function adds tax to the discounted price.

The result is printed as a receipt.

This is a real-world demonstration of how functions act as building blocks in software.

🔹 Key Takeaway

Functions bridge mathematics and software technology.
They transform inputs into outputs, just like formulas do in math. Every app—from banking to AI—is built on this principle.
