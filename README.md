# Physics-Concepts
This repository is made only for physics and math concepts that have intersection with Tech especially Machine Learning.
# 🔬⚙️ Math & Physics Meets Technology  

This repository is a collection of explorations where **physics and mathematics intersect with modern technology**. It’s a space for curious experiments, structured notes, and code-driven demonstrations that bring abstract concepts into practical and computational contexts.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
- To bridge **theoretical concepts** from math and physics with **applied technology**.  
- To create a growing library of **notebooks, code snippets, and explanations**.  
- To demonstrate how timeless scientific principles power the tools and systems we use today.  

---

## 📚 Topics You’ll Find Here  
- Classical & Modern Physics (mechanics, waves, relativity, quantum ideas)  
- Mathematical Foundations (algebra, calculus, probability, linear algebra)  
- Computational Models (simulations, visualizations, numerical methods)  
- Technology Links (AI, data science, engineering applications)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python (NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, Matplotlib), C++ (for simulations)  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git, LaTeX for clear math documentation  
- **Approach:** Clean, well-documented, experiment-driven code

"Physics and Math are the blueprints of Technology"
“The advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you don't really even notice it, so it's part of everyday life.” — Bill Gates
